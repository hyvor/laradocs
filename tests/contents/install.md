### Using the Plugin

Our [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hyvor-talk/) makes it easier to install Hyvor Talk on WordPress websites.

1. Log in into your Wordpress admin panel
2. Go to Plugins > Add New
3. Type "hyvor talk" in the search box
4. Find the plugin **"Comments by Hyvor Talk"**
5. Click install now and activate the plugin
6. Go to Hyvor Talk plugin and add your website ID and click Change. (Website ID can be copied from the Install section of the console.)

### Or Manually

You can also copy and paste the embed code to your website's source code. You'll need to edit your theme to do that.
        </div>
        <div key="wix" markdown="1">    
1. Go to the Wix Dahsboard and click "Edit Site".
2. Choose the page type you want to add comments to.

    ![Wix Page Type Selection](/img/docs/install-wix-page-select.png)
3. Add a Custom Element

    ![Wix Custom Element](/img/docs/install-wix-custom-element.png)

4. Click "Choose Source" and add change the settings.
    * Server URL: `https://talk.hyvor.com/web-api/integrations/wix/comments.js`
    * Tag Name: **wix-hyvor-talk**

    ![Wix Choose Source](/img/docs/install-wix-settings.png)

5. Next, click "Set Attributes" and "Set Attributes" again in the popup.

    ![Wix Attributes](/img/docs/install-wix-attributes.png)

        <div key="ghost" markdown="1">
To install Hyvor Talk on Ghost, you will need to change the theme template files.

1. Open the template file of your Ghost theme, which is usually `post.hbs` in your theme folder.
2. Then, copy and paste the embed code (take it from the Console) to the place you want comments to load.
3. Replace `id: false` with `id: "{{comment_id}}"` in the installation code. Then, we will use page IDs given by Ghost to identify pages, which works better than canonical URLs.

**Note:** Some themes may have the following code in the template file. If so, replace the "If you want to..." line with the copied embed code. Then, uncomment the block (remove the lines which contains `{{!--` and `--}}`).

```html
{{!--
    <section className="post-full-comments">
        If you want to add embed comments, this is a good place to do it!
    </section>
--}}
```     </div>
        <div key="vanilla-js" markdown="1">
The default embed code is a HTML code. However, you may sometimes need a JS-only solution for some applications. Even with this method, you'll need to have access to an element in the DOM or add `<div id="hyvor-talk-view"></div>` to the DOM.

If you haven't added `<div id="hyvor-talk-view"></div>` to your HTML code, use this code to do that.

```js
var commentsSection = document.getElementById("comments"); // change the ID to whatever element in your HTML page
var hyvorTalkView = document.createElement("div");
hyvorTalkView.id = "hyvor-talk-view";
commentsSection.appendChild(hyvorTalkView);
```

Then, add the embed script.

```js
var script = document.createElement("script");
script.type = "text/javascript";
script.src = "https://talk.hyvor.com/web-api/embed.js";
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

Copy and paste the following code to the layout files you need Hyvor Talk to load (Usually `_layouts/post.html` for posts). Make sure to replace `YOUR_WEBSITE_ID` with your actual website ID, which can be found at Console -> Install.

```html

<script type="text/javascript">
    var HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE = YOUR_WEBSITE_ID;
    var HYVOR_TALK_CONFIG = {

Copy and paste the following code to the template files you need Hyvor Talk to load (Usually `/themes/{theme_name}/layout/_partial/article.ejs` for posts). Make sure to replace `YOUR_WEBSITE_ID` with your actual website ID, which can be found at Console -> Install.

```html
<% if (!index && post.comments){ %>

    var HYVOR_TALK_CONFIG = {

    }

<script type="text/javascript" src="//talk.hyvor.com/web-api/embed"></script>
<% } %>
```
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Allowed Domains

For security, we only serve the embed on domains you whitelist the console (Console -> Website -> Install -> Allowed Domains). If you see a warning like this in the comments section, add the shown domain to the allowed domains list. 

![Allowed Domains Error](/img/docs/install-domain.png)

* Adding `example.com` whitelists both `example.com` and `www.example.com`.
* To allow all subdomains, use `*.example.com`.
* You can also allow all domains by adding `*` (Not recommended unless you have a network of domains)

## Changing Configuration

Page-level settings can be customized in the embed code. See [embed code](code) for more details.

Website-level settings can be changed from the Console's Appearance and Community sections.

* [Customizing Appearance](appearance)
* [Customizing Community](community)
* [Customizing Language](language)


## Single Sign-on

By default, commenters will need a Hyvor account to log in and comment. If you already have an authentication system on your website, you can automatically log in users by setting up Single Sign-on. View [SSO Docs](sso) for more details.


## Content Security Policy (CSP)

> This section is only for websites that use CSP headers.

[Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

If you use CSP headers on your website, make sure to add the following to the header to allow run the initial Javascript and load the iframe on your website.

* Add `https://talk.hyvor.com` to `script-src` (Initial script)
* Add `https://talk.hyvor.com` to `iframe-src` (Embed iframe)

We use inline Javascript to configure Hyvor Talk on each page. Make sure to allow the inline Javascript part in the embed code using one of these methods.

1. Generate a nonce (random string) in your backend and add `nonce-YOUR_NONCE` to `script-src` in the CSP header. Then, add the same nonce to the inline Javascript code.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" nonce="YOUR_NONCE">
        // HYVOR TALK CONFIGURATION
    </script>
    ```

2. Create a Base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the inline script and add it to `script-src` as `sha256-YOUR_HASH`. Browsers (Ex: Chromium-based) show an error in the browser console when inline scripts are used without whitelisting. You can easily get the encoded hash from the console.

    If you prefer generating it by yourself, there are some rules you should follow.

    * Convert `\r\n` spaces to `\n` in the script
    * Do not include `<script>` tags (both starting and ending) when calculating the hash
    * Use SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512 to hash the inline script.
    * Then encode the hashed string in Base64.
    * Replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` in the encoded string
    * Finally, add it to CSP header in `script-src` as `sha[HASH_TYPE]-[ENCODED HASH]` (Ex: `sha256-YOUR_HASH`)

    Here's the PHP code for generating hashes.

    ```php
    <?php
    $script = 'var HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE = 6; // DO NOT CHANGE THIS
    var HYVOR_TALK_CONFIG = {
        url: false,
        id: false
    };';
    $script = preg_replace('/\r\n/', "\n", $script);
    $sha = base64_encode(hash('sha256', $script, true));
    $sha = str_replace('-', '+', $sha);
    $sha = str_replace('_', '/', $sha);

    header("Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://talk.hyvor.com 'sha256-$sha'; frame-src 'self' https://talk.hyvor.com;");
    ```

3. Use `unsafe-inline` in `script-src` (Discouraged! This completely removes the security protection provided by CSP when running inline scripts. Do not use it unless you absolutely have to.)
